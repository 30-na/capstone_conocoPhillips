# Project Objectives: 
* Determine if correlations exist between completion type and production
* Determine if correlations exist between frac design and production
* Observe differences between formations
* Determine if a “sweet spot” exists in the basin
* Make a recommendation based on the observations above on the development of a hypothetical new 
drill project including where to drill, what formations to target and the completions design
